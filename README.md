# WeSafe
Android app built for women with an idea for their safe travelling. App provides a feature to scan number plate of any vehicle number plate(taxi/auto/e-rickshaw...) and get driver details such as name, photo, phone no., rating. Users can add their friends/family members in the app so they can track her while travelling or in case of emergency. App also provides locations which might be potentially unsafe for women travelling alone.
